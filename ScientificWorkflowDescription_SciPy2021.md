### The Learning Cliff: Computational Workflows

Working with scientific data and open source software requires understanding a myriad of tools and best practices. Analysis and visualization using python and open source relies on paradigms like imperative programming and for loops to write code and nuances in syntax like dot notation. After that, there's learning the internal functionality of individual packages, which are often domain specific. 

Interdisciplinary work provides an extra barrier, as new ways of thinking and new tools are added to the work load, butting heads with the domain focused tools available. While discovery and reconfiguration of software tools can be intersection of creativity and innovation, too often learning curves get in the way and slow research down, or cause the wheel to be reinvented over and over again in each domain. 

**Scientific workflow description** provides an alternative to the cognitive overhead of learning a new software package and use of imperative programming paradigms often used with python. We aim to unite the core aspects of interdisciplinary computational work using common natural science mental models while removing inherent domain-specific workflow and computing language barriers, creating an accessible scientific query environment. **This description is encoded in a JSON schema, accessed by the user through a configuration file, and run using python modules that attach the configuration file to the code which produces output.** 

In this case, 'the code' is [yt](http://yt-project.org/), an open source python library designed for scientific analysis and visualization of volumetric data from the physical sciences. We use yt, an computational astrophyics tool, to demonstrate how a domain specific software can operate within a descriptive framework.

### Describing Scientific Analysis and Visualization

What does it mean to *describe* a workflow? **We have developed a scientific workflow description prototype, which is divided into three different pieces - the JSON schema, a browser interface for user interaction, and a render-engine that will execute the code**. Using a configuration file which will live in the broswer, users can select actions and add appropriate data for those actions which are controled by the JSON schema. Users can then submit this file to the rendering engine, creating output for their work.

#### Using JSON as an Interface

JSON as an interface also user's to access properties defined in the JSON schema, and add data that conforms to the schema's specifications, which in turn are submitted to the code behind the interface. **User's only need to understand JSON notation to use the code, or in this case yt. They don't need to know python or yt at all to use those tools in their analysis.** They can simply describe what they want the code to do in the JSON configuration file, and an output is returned. 

The file is used as its own validation, as users objects that make up the workflow are validated against a JSON schema. Workflows can be unique to the user, but conform to a broad, domain specification. Making work in the analysis schema ease to create and reproduce. 





```python

```

#### Connecting Existing Software to Declarative Description

How does the description reach and run the software? The JSON schema used for the description contains key words, which are relayed back to the code and used to run the code with user input as arguments. This code is run and output is displayed to the user.

```python

```

#### The Analysis Schema

The analysis schema design provides a structured grammar from which users can describe and tell the story of their data analysis. It's meant to connect with the users understanding of the data, while accessing the code it needs to run the analysis. The schema has been developed to be flexible so users are free to complete operations in any order, while

### What is yt?

yt (https://yt-project.org/) is an open source python library designed for scientific analysis and visualization of volumetric data from the physical sciences. Historically yt was developed for computational astrophysics, but we aim to expand yt's capabilities to support: 

- __Geophysics__
- __Neuroimaging__
- __Weather__ 
- __Climate__
- __Oceanography__

Here's some yt examples:
