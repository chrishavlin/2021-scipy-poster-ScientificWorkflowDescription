    "### The Learning Cliff: Computational Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with scientific data and open source software requires understanding a myriad of tools and best practices. Analysis and visualization using python and open source relies on paradigms like imperative programming and for loops to write code and nuances in syntax like dot notation. After that, there's learning the internal functionality of individual packages, which are often domain specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interdisciplinary work provides an extra barrier, as new ways of thinking and new tools are added to the work load, butting heads with the domain focused tools available. While discovery and reconfiguration of software tools can be intersection of creativity and innovation, too often learning curves get in the way and slow research down, or cause the wheel to be reinvented over and over again in each domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Scientific workflow description** provides an alternative to the cognitive overhead of learning a new software package and use of imperative programming paradigms often used with python. We aim to unite the core aspects of interdisciplinary computational work using common natural science mental models while removing inherent domain-specific workflow barriers, creating an accessible scientific query environment. \n",

    "What does it mean to *describe* a workflow? We have developed a scientific workflow description prototype, which is divided into three different pieces - the JSON schema, a browser interface for user interaction, and a render-engine that will execute the code. Using a configuration file which will live in the broswer, users can select actions and add appropriate data for those actions which are controled by the JSON schema. Users can then submit this file to the rendering engine, creating output for their work.  \n",
